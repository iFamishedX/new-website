            <p>
              I build tooling across the Minecraft ecosystem — from client-side enhancements and performance tweaks to server plugins
              and full backend infrastructure. Most of what I do is about making servers easier to run, automate, and observe, so
              people can focus on actually playing instead of fighting their stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recent work includes projects like HungerBridge and HungerLib, which connect Minecraft servers to external tools,
              dashboards, and automation workflows. I care a lot about clean APIs, predictable behavior, and making it simple to
              plug Minecraft into the rest of your infrastructure without a ton of boilerplate.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the infrastructure side, I lean heavily on Cloudflare, Pterodactyl, and custom projects to keep things fast,
              secure, and resilient. That means edge routing, remote execution endpoints, log streaming, and status polling — all
              wired together so SMPs and production servers can be monitored, controlled, and scaled with confidence.
